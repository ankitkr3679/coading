      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.

        <br> Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand, reusing, and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.[18]</p>

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">The knowledge of programming</p>
      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">This meaning for compiler</p>
      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[11] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[12][13] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[14] and many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.

         <br>These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[14] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation. </p>
